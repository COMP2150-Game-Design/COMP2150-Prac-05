# Week 05 - Level Design 1
Today we will be moving from our Challenge design to turning these Challenges into encounters, these encounters into our level, and creating the connective tissue between these different elements.

## Tools used
Today's task uses (but is not limited to):

* Github Desktop (or your Github client of choice)
* Unity
* A prototyping tool of your choice. Some options:
    * Powerpoint
    * Virtual Graph Paper
    * draw.io
    * Adobe Illustrator
    * Good ol' fashioned pen and paper!

## Assignment deliverable
Today, you will begin work on the encounter design and prototyping of your level. These are elements that you must document in your report, so you should be making sure to add photos/screenshots of whatever you create today into your repo. If you are creating your prototypes physically (such as in a notebook), make sure you retain the drafts just in case. If you are using a drawing program, keep the necessary files so you can come back and edit or restore them later.

## Section 1 Encounters Design (30 min)
We are going to start our level design proper via encounter design, as discussed in this week's lecture.

When crafting your encounters, you want to think of them as <b>units of gameplay</b>. Exactly how this looks in your game will depend on what you are trying to achieve, and may even evolve between encounters. However, some questions to ask about your encounters are:
* Should this be a single screen, where the player can see all the "pieces" at once?
* Should this be a bigger section of a level, which might involve movement around space with the camera doing the same?
* Should this leverage the revealing and hiding of elements, such as having the player move between two areas a couple of times as "one encounter"?

Level design is about the movement of the player in physical space, so take a moment to think about and write down how the player moves and views space in your game. Write down:

* How does the player get from one location to the next? What is hard/easy about this movement?
* What can the player see? How big a view do they have of the world, and how does this change as they move about?

With these broad understandings of your game and its design in mind, it is time to start designing your first encounters.

You'll likely move back-and-forth between your different sections. However, we're going to start by designing some encounters for section 1, informed by the challenge design work you did last week.

### Reviewing your challenges
Go back and take a look at the challenges you made last week. Which ones resonated with you? What did you decide to base a lot of your gameplay on? Identify the elements that you need to introduce the player to (remember, this should be <b>all</b> the required features mentioned in the spec, plus any of the optional ones you are introducing).

Consider what the important mechanical elements of these features are, and the related dynamics, that you need to introduce your player to in the first section of your level. Be deliberate here - if you plan on using switches, but you're not allowing the player to shoot them, you don't need to teach them about this mechanic. Additionally, more complex dynamics that come with the further combination of elements don't all need to be showcased here, as this might overwhelm the player.

#### Storyboarding
Now, begin crafting an encounter to introduce your player to one of more of these features. In some cases, you will want to introduce a feature in total isolation (such as a moving platform). Other times, it might be necessary and more engaging to introduce two or more at once (such as the acid pit and checkpoint). There are no hard and fast rules here - refer back to the design theory presented in this week's lecture to understand how to craft these.

One of the only prescribed forms of prototypes in the assignment is storyboards for these initial encounters. So, start drafting out some storyboards for this encounter. We will be diving into this form a bit more next week, but for now simply map out a few sketches (either pen and paper, or using some basic drawing tools like those listed about) to show the sequence of events in your encounter: 
* How does the player approach these elements? What do they observe? 
* What are the broad-stroke responses they can make, and what are the consequences? E.g, the player misses the jump and hits the acid pit, so respawns and starts again.

Don't get too hung up on the spatialisation of this just yet - you want to keep those constraints we mentioned before about movement and what the player can see in mind to stop you from going off the rails, but you will be working out the details later.

Try to create two-three different encounters. You'll be coming back to this later in your design process (probably outside of class!), so let's not get too in the weeds here.

### Reflect
Include a section on reflection to ensure students are doing something with their knowledge in the moment.

## Next Week
Next week you will move from these storyboards and other prototypes to work on your level from a geometric perspective, both in and out of engine.
