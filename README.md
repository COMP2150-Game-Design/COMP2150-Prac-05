# Week 05 - Level Design 1
Today we will be moving from our Challenge design to turning these Challenges into encounters, these encounters into our level, and creating the connective tissue between these different elements.

## Tools used
Today's task uses (but is not limited to):

* Github Desktop (or your Github client of choice)
* Unity
* A prototyping tool of your choice. Some options:
    * Powerpoint
    * Virtual Graph Paper
    * draw.io
    * Adobe Illustrator
    * Good ol' fashioned pen and paper!

## Assignment deliverable
Today, you will begin work on the encounter design and prototyping of your level. These are elements that you must document in your report, so you should be making sure to add photos/screenshots of whatever you create today into your repo. If you are creating your prototypes physically (such as in a notebook), make sure you retain the drafts just in case. If you are using a drawing program, keep the necessary files so you can come back and edit or restore them later.

### Reflect
Include a section on reflection to ensure students are doing something with their knowledge in the moment.

## Next Week
Next week you will move from these storyboards and other prototypes to work on your level from a geometric perspective, both in and out of engine.
